 *	ユーザ辞書: the words a person registers for かな漢字変換 (design 11.16)
 *
 *	The dictionary is text, UTF-8, a line to a word:
 *
 *	  よみ<TAB>単語<TAB>品詞<LF>
 *
 *	the form the common converters write their user dictionaries out in
 *	and read them in from, and the form it is kept in: record 1 of the
 *	user dictionary object (SYSDEF_DICT_USER). The lines are kept in the
 *	order of their readings, and of their words under one reading; one
 *	word is in it once under a reading. A part of speech is one of the
 *	names below; their numbers are the converter's (mozc's PosType).
 *
 *	Reading other files in, lines starting with ! or # are passed over
 *	(the heading lines another converter writes), UTF-16 with its byte
 *	order mark is read as such, the names of the parts of speech other
 *	converters use are taken as the nearest of these, and a reading in
 *	katakana is taken in hiragana.
 *
 *	Nothing here makes a system call or takes memory: what is read is
 *	the caller's bytes, what is written goes into the caller's buffer.
 *	The converter (application/kconv), the accessory 単語登録
 *	(application/worddic) and the kernel's test all use it.
