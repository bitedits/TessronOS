/*
 *	rtmedia.h
 *	What the player of 実時間制御TAD (in the desktop) says to the
 *	processes that make its sound and its pictures move (design 15.6)
 *
 *	The desktop cannot decode a compressed file in the kernel: that is
 *	floating point and libraries a kernel does not carry. So whatever
 *	sounds -- a file of audio, the notes and MIDI messages of the
 *	program, the PCM a record carries -- is done by the process
 *	実時間メディア (application/rtmedia), and a video by MPEG Player
 *	started in its own way for it (--embed). Each is started with an
 *	RTM_ARG as its start-up argument and is told what to do by
 *	messages on a channel the desktop made; it answers on another, and
 *	a video puts its frames where the desktop reads them.
 *
 *	The messages are fixed records, little endian, one a channel
 *	message (at most OB_CH_MSG_MAX bytes). Times are nanoseconds of the
 *	monotonic clock both sides read (ts_get_mono); a sound is to be
 *	heard at its time plus the latency the process keeps, the same for
 *	every sound, so the time between two sounds is kept to the sample.
