/*
 *	rtad.h
 *	実時間制御TAD: the engine that plays the <realtime> part of an
 *	xmlTAD record (design 15)
 *
 *	The engine reads the elements of a <realtime> once into a program
 *	and runs it against a clock it is given. It keeps the state of
 *	everything the program moves -- the shapes, texts, pictures and
 *	videos on the screen, the sounds and their media -- and tells
 *	whoever plays it what to sound and what to load, through the
 *	functions of an RT_HOST. It draws nothing, reads no file, makes no
 *	system call and uses no floating point, so the desktop (in the
 *	kernel), a process and the kernel's tests run the same code
 *	(lib/librtad).
 *
 *	Times are microseconds of the clock the caller passes in (RT_TIME);
 *	every other quantity -- a length, an alpha, an angle, a volume -- is
 *	kept in millionths (RT_V), so 0.5 is 500000. Values are read from
 *	the record's decimal text without rounding through a float.
 *
 *	The record must stay parsed for as long as the program runs: the
 *	program points into its attribute values rather than copying them.
