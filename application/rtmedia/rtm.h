 *	rtm.h
 *	実時間メディア: the process that sounds what a program of
 *	実時間制御TAD plays (design 15.6)
 *
 *	Three tasks. The main task reads the desktop's channel and does what
 *	it says; the loader reads and decodes the files it is asked to make
 *	ready, so that a long file being decoded holds up no note; the mixer
 *	makes the sound a few milliseconds at a time -- the files, the notes
 *	of the instruments, the sounds the record carries -- and writes it
 *	to the sound device "snda", keeping it a fixed time ahead of what is
 *	heard. A sound asked for at a time is put at the sample that will be
 *	heard then, plus that fixed time, so two sounds are as far apart as
 *	the program put them.
 *
 *	Floating point is used here (the process's tasks keep the FP
 *	registers), and a sine is read from a table, not worked out.
