/*
 *	dttype.c
 *	Letters a program types into the window the keys went to before
 *	(DT_RQ_TYPE of ts/dtreq.h, docs/tessronos/11-desktop.md 11.19)
 *
 *	A program that offers letters to be typed -- 文字検索 -- has the
 *	keys itself while it is worked, so the window meant is the one that
 *	had them before it. The desktop keeps the last few windows the keys
 *	went to, newest first, and types into the newest that is still there
 *	and is not the asking program's own:
 *
 *	  a text of the desktop's, or a piece of text being edited in a
 *	  figure: the letters go in at the caret as the converter's
 *	  committed letters do (dd_type_text), whatever was being composed
 *	  committed first
 *	  a window with a panel whose box has the keys: into the box at its
 *	  caret, as the panel's own conversion commits (wm_panel_type)
 *
 *	Any other window answers E_NOEXS, and the program does what it
 *	does instead (文字検索 puts the letters in the tray).
